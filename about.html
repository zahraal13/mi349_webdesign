    <h1>Careers in Web Design</h1>
<body>Since I may be interested in a career in web design in the future, I decided to explore this topic. The first thing I learned, or was reminded of, was that practice is the most important thing. Whether its side gigs, blogs, personal projects, or anything else you have to work on your skills to get better. Along with practice you should stay up to date on the current industry and trends. Technology is something that is obviously constantly changing and improving so you have to make sure you are adapting to that. You should consider yourself a lifelong learner of web design. You can use conferences, web courses, books, and YouTube to help keep up your skills. Using open sources tech can also help you learn new skills. 

    In general, a BA or BS in a related field is required but sometimes for certain positions you would specifically need a computer science or engineering degree. Some positions also require an advanced degree, but they are not necessary unless you are looking into that position. 4 years degrees are important but becoming less relevant nowadays.

    <h2>Some possible roles out of school</h2>
    <body>You could work as a junior front end developer, designer, or UX engineer. You could possibly a mid FE/Designer/UX with experience of about 2-3 years. You will be expected to learn and grow, be a good mentee, ask good questions, know the basics, as well as know the ins and outs of sprint work.</body>

    <h2>Tips on the interview and first day</h2>
    <body>The first important thing to keep in mind is you have to be nice and be on time. Research the company and come prepared with questions. You may be asked to do a small coding project in the interview so come prepared with all you know about the job. Be prepared for any questions you may receive about the job you are applying for.  You should be 100% settled in after the first month. Donâ€™t stop asking questions.</body>
